# Jaime-the-chatbot
This is the text based chat bot used to answer our queries about the particular college. This chat bot gives information about the college. 

This is the rule based chatbot and python is used as a backend language.

Visual studio code is the preffered software to run the chatbot.

NOTE: Install corresponding libraries before run the train.py and app.py files.

There is the file called "intents.json" where the patterns and responses of the chatboy are stored. You can edit the responses and patterns by your wish.

Step 1: Open train.py file and run the program to create the model for the chatbot.
Step 2: Then run the app.py file to generate a link in a terminal. The link looks like http/... something.
Step 3: Copy the link and open into the browser.

Then the Jaime the chatbot is run as a web application. That will give responses about the college information.
